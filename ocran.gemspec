  spec.description = "OCRAN (One-Click Ruby Application Next) builds Windows executables from Ruby source code. 
  The executable is a self-extracting, self-running executable that contains the Ruby interpreter, your source code and any additionally needed ruby libraries or DLL.
  
  This is a fork of OCRA that is compatible with ruby version after 3.0.
  Migration guide: make sure to write ocran instead of ocra in your code. For instance: OCRAN_EXECUTABLE

  usage: 
    ocra helloworld.rb
    helloworld.exe

  See readme at https://github.com/largo/ocran
  Report problems in the github issues. Contributions welcome.
  This gem contains executables. We plan to build them on github actions for security.
