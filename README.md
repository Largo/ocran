## Description

OCRAN (One-Click Ruby Application Next) builds Windows executables from Ruby
source code. The executable is a self-extracting, self-running
executable that contains the Ruby interpreter, your source code and
any additionally needed ruby libraries or DLL.

OCRAN is a fork of Ocra (https://github.com/larsch/ocra) in order to
maintain compatibility with newer Ruby versions after 3.2

## Recommended usage
Most commonly you will needs this, when you want to ship your program to windows servers / users that don't have Ruby installed.
By default each time the .exe is opened it will extract the ruby interpeter along with the code to the temp directory.
Since this process takes time, we recommend using the innosetup edition which will install your program together with the ruby intepreter into
a directory.

## Features

* LZMA Compression (optional, default on)
* Both windowed/console mode supported
* Includes gems based on usage, or from a Bundler Gemfile

## Problems & Bug Reporting

* Windows support only

If you experience problems with OCRAN or have found a bug, please use
the issue tracker on GitHub (http://github.com/largo/ocran/issues).

## Safety

As this gem comes with binaries, we have taken actions to insure your safety.
The gem releases are built on Github Actions. Feel free verify that it matches the version on rubygems.
It ships with seb.exe and LZMA.exe in this repository, which come from official sources.

## Installation

Gem:

    gem install ocran

Alternatively you can download the gem at either
http://rubygems.org/gems/ocran or
https://github.com/largo/ocran/releases/.

### Compilation:

* OCRAN will load your script (using `Kernel#load`) and build
  the executable when it exits.

* Your program should 'require' all necessary files when invoked without
  arguments, so OCRAN can detect all dependencies.

* DLLs are detected automatically but only those located in your Ruby
  installation are included.

* .rb files will become console applications. .rbw files will become
  windowed application (without a console window popping
  up). Alternatively, use the `--console` or
  `--windows` options.

### Running your application:

* The 'current working directory' is not changed by OCRAN when running
  your application. You must change to the installation or temporary
  directory yourself. See also below.
* When the application is running, the OCRAN_EXECUTABLE environment
  variable points to the .exe (with full path).
* The temporary location of the script can be obtained by inspected
  the $0 variable.
* OCRAN does not set up the include path. Use `$:.unshift
  File.dirname($0)` at the start of your script if you need to
  'require' additional source files from the same directory as your
  main script.

### Pitfalls:

* Avoid modifying load paths at run time. Specify load paths using -I
  or RUBYLIB if you must, but don't expect OCRAN to preserve them for
  runtime. OCRAN may pack sources into other directories than you
  expect.
* If you use .rbw files or the `--windows` option, then check
  that your application works with rubyw.exe before trying with OCRAN.
* Avoid absolute paths in your code and when invoking OCRAN.

### Multibyte path and filename support:

* OCRAN-built executables can correctly handle multibyte paths and filenames
  (e.g., Japanese or emoji) on Windows. To use this feature, the executable
  must be run on Windows 10 version 1903 or later.
* When using OCRAN-built executables from the console, we recommend running
  `chcp 65001` to switch the code page to UTF-8. This ensures proper
  input/output of multibyte characters in Command Prompt (CMD) and
  PowerShell.

## REQUIREMENTS:

* Windows
* Working Ruby installation.
* Ruby Installation with devkit from rubyinstaller (when working with the source code only)

## Development

### Quick start

Quickly set up the development environment and run the full test suite:

    git clone https://github.com/largo/ocran.git
    cd ocran
    bin/setup          # install Bundler & all dev gems, generate stub for tests
    bundle exec rake   # run the entire Minitest suite

### Developer Utilities (bin/ scripts)

All scripts in the `bin/` directory are designed for developers and can be executed in any standard Windows shell, including Command Prompt (CMD), PowerShell, and Git Bash.

| Script        | Purpose                                                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bin/setup`   | Installs Bundler and all required development gems, then builds stub.exe |
| `bin/console` | Launches an IRB console with OCRAN preloaded                             |


### Rake tasks (Windows compatible)

| Task         | Purpose                                                                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rake build` | Compile stub.exe (requires MSVC or mingwâ€‘w64 + DevKit)                 |
| `rake clean` | Remove generated binaries (e.g., stub.exe); temp files are not deleted |
| `rake test`  | Execute all unit & integration tests                                   |

## Technical details

OCRAN first runs the target script in order to detect any files that
are loaded and used at runtime (Using `Kernel#require` and
`Kernel#load`).

OCRAN embeds everything needed to run a Ruby script into a single
executable file. The file contains the .exe stub which is compiled
from C-code, and a custom opcode format containing instructions to
create directories, save files, set environment variables and run
programs. The OCRAN script generates this executable and the
instructions to be run when it is launched.

When executed, the OCRAN stub extracts the Ruby interpreter and your
scripts into a temporary directory. The directory will contains the
same directory layout as your Ruby installlation. The source files for
your application will be put in the 'src' subdirectory.

### Libraries

Any code that is loaded through `Kernel#require` when your
script is executed will be included in the OCRAN
executable. Conditionally loaded code will not be loaded and included
in the executable unless the code is actually run when OCRAN invokes
your script. Otherwise, OCRAN won't know about it and will not include
the source files.

RubyGems are handled specially. Whenever a file from a Gem is
detected, OCRAN will attempt to include all the required files from
that specific Gem, expect some unlikely needed files such as readme's
and other documentation. This behaviour can be controlled by using the
--gem-* options. Behaviour can be changed for all gems or specific
gems using --gem-*=gemname.

Libraries found in non-standard path (for example, if you invoke OCRAN
with "ruby -I some/path") will be placed into the site dir
(lib/ruby/site_ruby). Avoid changing `$LOAD_PATH` or
`$:` from your script to include paths outside your source
tree, since OCRAN may place the files elsewhere when extracted into the
temporary directory.

In case your script (or any of its dependencies) sets up autoloaded
module using `Kernel#autoload`, OCRAN will automatically try to
load them to ensure that they are all included in the
executable. Modules that doesn't exist will be ignored (a warning will
be logged).

Dynamic link libraries (.dll files, for example WxWidgets, or other
source files) will be detected and included by OCRAN.

### Including libraries non-automatically

If an application or framework is complicated enough that it tends
to confuse Ocran's automatic dependency resolution, then you can
use other means to specify what needs to be packaged with your app.

To disable automatic dependency resolution, use the `--no-dep-run`
option; with it, Ocran will skip executing your program during the
build process. This on the other hand requires using `--gem-full` option
(see more below); otherwise Ocran will not include all the necessary
files for the gems.

You will also probably need to use the `--add-all-core` option to
include the Ruby core libraries.

If your app uses gems, then you can specify them in a
Bundler (http://gembundler.com) Gemfile, then use the --gemfile
option to supply it to Ocran. Ocran will automatically include all
gems specified, and all their dependencies.

(Note: This assumes that the gems are installed in your system,
*not* locally packaged inside the app directory by "bundle package")

These options are particularly useful for packaging Rails
applications.  For example, to package a Rails 3 app in the
directory "someapp" and create an exe named "someapp.exe", without
actually running the app during the build, you could use the
following command:

    ocran someapp/script/rails someapp --output someapp.exe --add-all-core \
    --gemfile someapp/Gemfile --no-dep-run --gem-full --chdir-first -- server

Note the space between `--` and `server`! It's important; `server` is
an argument to be passed to rails when the script is ran.

Rails 2 apps can be packaged similarly, though you will have to
integrate them with Bundler (http://gembundler.com/rails23.html)
first.

### Gem handling

By default, Ocran includes all scripts that are loaded by your script
when it is run before packaging. Ocran detects which gems are using and
includes any additional non-script files from those gems, except
trivial files such as C/C++ source code, object files, READMEs, unit
tests, specs, etc.

This behaviour can be changed by using the --gem-* options. There are
four possible modes:

* *minimal*: Include only loaded scripts
* *guess*: Include loaded scripts and important files (DEFAULT)
* *all*: Include all scripts and important files
* *full*: Include all files

If you find that files are missing from the resulting executable, try
first with --gem-all=gemname for the gem that is missing, and if that
does not work, try --gem-full=gemname. The paranoid can use --gem-full
to include all files for all required gems.

### Creating an installer for your application

To make your application start up quicker, or to allow it to
keep files in its application directory between runs, or if
you just want to make your program seem more like a "regular"
Windows application, you can have Ocran generate an installer
for your app with the free Inno Setup software.

You will first have to download and install Inno Setup 5 or
later, and also add its directory to your PATH (so that Ocran
can find the ISCC compiler program). Once you've done that,
you can use the `--innosetup` option to Ocran to supply an
Inno Setup script. Do not add any [Files] or [Dirs] sections
to the script; Ocran will figure those out itself.

To continue the Rails example above, let's package the Rails 3
app into an installer. Save the following as `someapp.iss`:

  [Setup]
  AppName=SomeApp
  AppVersion=0.1
  DefaultDirName={pf}\SomeApp
  DefaultGroupName=SomeApp
  OutputBaseFilename=SomeAppInstaller

  [Icons]
  Name: "{group}\SomeApp"; Filename: "{app}\someapp.bat"; IconFilename: "{app}\someapp.ico"; Flags: runminimized;
  Name: "{group}\Uninstall SomeApp"; Filename: "{uninstallexe}"

Then, run Ocran with this command:

    ocran someapp/script/rails someapp --output someapp.exe --add-all-core \
    --gemfile someapp/Gemfile --no-dep-run --gem-full --chdir-first --no-lzma \
    --icon someapp.ico --innosetup someapp.iss -- server

If all goes well, a file named "SomeAppInstaller.exe" will be placed
into the Output directory.

### Environment variables

OCRAN executables clear the RUBYLIB environment variable before your
script is launched. This is done to ensure that your script does not
use load paths from the end user's Ruby installation.

OCRAN executables set the RUBYOPT environment variable to the value it
had when you invoked OCRAN. For example, if you had "RUBYOPT=rubygems"
on your build PC, OCRAN ensures that it is also set on PC's running the
executables.

OCRAN executables set OCRAN_EXECUTABLE to the full path of the
executable, for example

    ENV["OCRAN_EXECUTABLE"] # => C:\Program Files\MyApp\MyApp.exe

### Working directory

The OCRAN executable does not change the working directory when it is
launched, unless you use the `--chdir-first` option.

You should not assume that the current working directory when invoking
an executable built with .exe is the location of the source script. It
can be the directory where the executable is placed (when invoked
through the Windows Explorer), the users' current working directory
(when invoking from the Command Prompt), or even
`C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32` when the executable is invoked through
a file association.

With the `--chdir-first` option, the working directory will
always be the common parent directory of your source files. This
should be fine for most applications. However, if your application
is designed to run from the command line and take filenames as
arguments, then you cannot use this option.

If you wish to maintain the user's working directory, but need to
`require` additional Ruby scripts from the source directory, you can
add the following line to your script:

    $LOAD_PATH.unshift File.dirname($0)

### Load path mangling

Adding paths to `$LOAD_PATH` or `$:` at runtime is not
recommended. Adding relative load paths depends on the working
directory being the same as where the script is located (See
above). If you have additional library files in directories below the
directory containing your source script you can use this idiom:

    $LOAD_PATH.unshift File.join(File.dirname($0), 'path/to/script')

### Detecting

You can detect whether OCRAN is currently building your script by
looking for the 'Ocran' constant. If it is defined, OCRAN is currenly
building the executable from your script. For example, you can use
this to avoid opening a GUI window when compiling executables:

    app = MyApp.new
    app.main_loop unless defined?(Ocran)

### Additional files and resources

You can add additional files to the OCRAN executable (for example
images) by appending them to the command line. They should be placed
in the source directory with your main script (or a subdirectory).

    ocran mainscript.rb someimage.jpeg docs/document.txt

This will create the following layout in the temporary directory when
your program is executed:

    src/mainscript.rb
    src/someimage.jpeg
    src/docs/document.txt

Both files, directoriess and glob patterns can be specified on the
command line. Files will be added as-is. If a directory is specified,
OCRAN will include all files found below that directory. Glob patterns
(See Dir.glob) can be used to specify a specific set of files, for
example:

    ocran script.rb assets/**/*.png

### Command Line Arguments

To pass command line argument to your script (both while building and
when run from the resulting executable), specify them after a
`--` marker. For example:

    ocran script.rb -- --some-options=value

This will pass `--some-options=value` to the script when
build and when running the executable. Any extra argument specified by
the user when invoking the executable will be appended after the
compile-time arguments.

### Window/Console

By default, OCRAN builds console application from .rb-files and
windowed applications (without console window) from .rbw-files.

Ruby on Windows provides two executables: ruby.exe is a console mode
application and rubyw.exe is a windowed application which does not
bring up a console window when launched using the Windows Explorer.
By default, or if the `--console` option is used, OCRAN will
use the console runtime (ruby.exe). OCRAN will automatically select the
windowed runtime when your script has the ".rbw" extension, or if you
specify the `--windows` command line option.

If your application works in console mode but not in windowed mode,
first check if your script works without OCRAN using rubyw.exe. A
script that prints to standard output (using puts, print etc.) will
eventually cause an exception when run with rubyw.exe (when the IO
buffers run full).

You can also try wrapping your script in an exception handler that
logs any errors to a file:

    begin
      # your script here
    rescue Exception => e
      File.open("except.log") do |f|
        f.puts e.inspect
        f.puts e.backtrace
      end
    end
