=== 1.3.17
- Modified `rake test` to no longer build stubs during test execution. Use `rake build_stub` when stub generation is necessary.
- New `rake build` task as a unified build entry point, delegating to `build_stub`.
- Updated GitHub Actions and internal scripts to use `rake build` instead of `rake build_stub`.
- Add full support for multibyte (UTF-8) names across executables, scripts, and resources. Requires Windows 10 version 1903 or later.
- Added UTF-8 manifest to stub.exe to enable UTF-8 support in ANSI API calls.
- Update Bundler from 2.5.10 to 2.5.23. This is the last Bundler version officially supporting Ruby 3.0.
- Added `bin/setup` and `bin/console` scripts for development (both Bash and Windows .bat versions).
- `bin/setup` now installs dependencies and builds stub executables automatically.
- Improved `spec.files` to explicitly include README, LICENSE, and CHANGELOG.
- Introduced a `Development` section in the README with setup instructions and Windows shell compatibility.
- Updated copyright year in README and LICENSE.

=== 1.3.16
- Support for Ruby 3.0 and above. Drop ruby 2.6 and 2.7 support.
- At startup, OCRAN no longer automatically removes directories that were previously deployed but couldn't be deleted. This change has been made to enhance security by preventing processes other than the startup process from manipulating temporary files created by them.
- The ability for the stub to launch any script during the unpacking of application files has been removed. This feature was not in use.
- The exit code from the Ruby application is now returned when the stub is terminated.
- The packed data no longer contains redundant directory information.
- Fixed errors in the --debug option.
- Upgraded LZMA decoder to version 22.01
- The directory generation for file extraction has been changed to use unique directory names created with high-resolution timestamps. Additionally, a retry limit for directory creation has been introduced, reducing the risk of infinite loops due to name collisions.
- Implemented variable-length buffer handling for path strings in stub, eliminating the risk of buffer overruns dependent on MAX_PATH.
- In order to reduce security risks during the cleanup process before application termination, we have implemented a safe current directory change from the system directory and the root of the C drive to the user's temporary directory and the directory of the app executable.
- The 'stub' executable has been enhanced for security, ensuring it prevents directory traversal attacks by verifying that path elements do not contain relative notations like '.' or '..'.
- Removed OcranBuilder and split functionality into StubBuilder and InnoSetupBuilder to introduce delayed loading and improve resource efficiency.
- InnoSetup installer now operates independently of stub, launching through its own batch file.
- Moved LibraryDetector to a separate file for modularity and implemented delayed loading with standardized Fiddle usage.
- Update Bundler from 2.4.13 to 2.5.10.
- Fixed issue where the gem.build_complete file was not included in the package due to an incorrect change.
- Changed error output from standard output to standard error (stderr).
- ocransa (Ocran-stand-alone) has been discontinued.
- The implementation of bin/ocran.rb has been refactored and split into multiple files. These files have been relocated to the lib directory.

=== 1.3.15
- Support for Ruby 2.6 and above.
- Properly display errors from InnoSetup.
- Fixed errors when creating an installer using InnoSetup. Previously, installer creation was not possible due to errors related to file sharing, which occurred only on Windows.
- Retrieve the path of runtime DLLs even when the path is long. Note that stubs still do not support long paths, so creating executable files with long paths is not yet possible.
- Fixed bugs in tests. All tests can now be executed.
- Improved the speed of manifest file discovery. This manifest file is only required in the RubyInstaller environment.
- Fixed bugs in the regular expressions of GEM_EXTRA_RE. This allows excluding C source files, etc., from the ocran executable package based on command options.
- Added methods to Ocran::Pathname, making it closer to the implementation of Ruby's Pathname.
- Reimplemented certain parts to match the implementation of Ruby 2.6 era, for compatibility with older Ruby versions. Therefore, the ocran command cannot be executed on Ruby versions earlier than 2.6.

=== 1.3.14
- Add option to suppress or override RUBYOPT environment variable #3 by ccorn90

=== 1.3.13
- Fixed the bug why Innosetup did not run because of missing encode method 
- Fix an issue where rubyinstaller did not find the msys path by putting in an empty msys-2.0.dll into msys64/usr/bin/msys-2.0.dll
- compatibility with the tiny_tds gem (see above)
- GitHub builds through github action: making sure you can trust the included binaries.
- Added some samples including the glimmer-libui GUI example. GUI that starts fast.

* Update lzma.exe to version 22.01

=== 1.3.11

* Support Ruby 2.2-2.7
* Add ruby2_keywords.rb to ignored modules
* Update lzma.exe to version 19.00
* Workaround for warning about deprecated Object#=~
* Use Fiddle instead of Win32API
* Fix for invalid argument to relative_path_from

=== 1.3.10

* Reduce memory usage while building & compressing (avoids out of
  memory issue on really big programs).

* Compile stub.exe with 32-bit compiler again

=== 1.3.9

* Support Ruby 2.4.1p111 (include manifest)

=== 1.3.8

* Use GetModuleFileNameW for DLL detection

=== 1.3.7

* Workaround for handling of file names and directory name with
  non-ASCII characters (e.g. "invalid byte sequence in UTF-8")

=== 1.3.6

* More robust cleanup of temporary files. Deletes using manual
  recursive method instead of using the shell. Will mark files for
  later deletion both using Windows (requires Administrator
  privileges) and a custom method that will remove old temporary files
  when the executable is restarted.

=== 1.3.5

* Fixes for Ruby 2.2.2p95

=== 1.3.4

* Workarounds for Ruby 2.1.5

=== 1.3.3

* Rebuild executables with MinGW GCC 4.8.1-4.

=== 1.3.2

* Refactored Gemfile handling for better compatibility with Ruby
  version.

=== 1.3.1

* Now includes $LOADED_FEATURES even when script is not run to check
  dependencies. This fixes compatability with Ruby 1.9.3 where
  rubygems is always loaded.

* Fixed compatability with Ruby 2.0.0: Temp-path alias in binary
  changed to be valid UTF-8 character.

* README.txt updated related to --no-dep-run (karhatsu).

* Fixes for Bundler handling (DavidMikeSimon).

=== 1.3.0

* Fixed some additional corner cases with absolute and relative
  require & load paths. Extended test suite to cover a lot more
  cases.

* Now provides a meaningful exit status code (1 on error, 0 on
  success). (DavidMikeSimon)

* New option to _not_ run the script to detect dependencies
  (--no-dep-run). (DavidMikeSimon)

* Bundler support using the --gemfile option. (DavidMikeSimon)

* Debug mode support in the stub (--debug). Also --debug-extract to
  keep extracted files from executable. (DavidMikeSimon)

* New gem behaviour yet again due to changes in Rubygems. See README
  file.

=== 1.2.0

* Ignore console events (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Break). Ruby process handles
  them anyway and exist, allowing the stub to clean up temporary
  files.

* Temporary memory used for decompression is now freed before the ruby
  interpreter is launched by the stub.

* Progress dialog is no longer displayed when removing temporary
  files.

* Now includes most files from any require'd Rubygem (Now works with
  mime-types, oledb and other gems that load additional data files
  from the Gem installation). Some files are still ignored
  (e.g. Readme's). Use "--no-gem-filter" to make Ocra unconditionally
  include all files listed in the Gem specification (Thanks to Jorge
  L. Cangas for patch & ideas).

* NameErrors are now rescued when attempting to load autoloadable
  constants. Hopefully resolves issues with ActiveRecord [#28488].

* Now works if the script changes environment or working directory
  while running.

* Fixed a regression in 1.1.4 when resource files are specified;
  directory layout would not be maintained, e.g. when running "ocra
  bin/script share/data.dat".

* Added support for passing arguments to script. Specify argument to
  your script after a "--" marker. Arguments will be passed both at
  compile time and run time. (#27815)

* Now works if the source files are located beneath Ruby's
  exec_prefix. (#28505)

=== 1.1.4

* The tempdir marker is now pretty-printed as "<tempdir>" in the
  output.

* Fixed various issues with path and filenames being handled case
  sensitive.

* Now uses config settings for Ruby executable names (should now also
  work with ruby installations built with --program-suffix).

* Supported invoking ocra with an absolute path to the script. Will
  assume that the script is in the root of the source hierachy.

=== 1.1.3

* Use Win32API (provided with Ruby) instead of win32-api (gem).

* No longer sets GEM_HOME (which would override the default gem
  path). Instead sets GEM_PATH. Resolves issues with gems not loading
  on Ruby 1.9.

=== 1.1.2

* Warnings can be disabled using --no-warnings.

* Fixed not .exe being generated when script calls 'exit'.

* Path to the generated executable is now avilable to the running
  script in the OCRA_EXECUTABLE environment variable.

* Directories on the command line will now be created.

* Supports path globs, fx. "ocra script.rb assets/**/*.png". (See
  documentation for Ruby's Dir class).

* Fixed issue with spaces in temporary path (TMP environment).

* Improved path comparison to ignore case (this is Windows after all)
  and be a bit more robust.

* Added support for RubyGems installed in GEM_HOME (or other part
  handled by RubyGems). If not installed in the Ruby hierarchy, they
  will now be installed in a directory named 'gemhome' under the
  temporary directory.

=== 1.1.1

* Fixed duplicate entries in the RUBYLIB environment variable.

* Another slight fix for relative load paths.

* RUBYOPT is now set to the value it had when OCRA was invoked.

=== 1.1.0

* Added an icon to the executable. Can be replaced from a .ico file
  using the --icon <ico> option.

* Improved handling of load paths added either from the command line
  (ruby -I), RUBYLIB environment variable or during the script (by
  modifying $: or $LOAD_PATH).

* Now automatically detects loaded DLLs through Win32::API. Disable
  with --no-autodll.

=== 1.0.3 / 2009-05-25

* Fixed invokation of executables with spaces in path names (#25966).

* Fixed inverted handling of --windows & --console (#25974)

* Fixed installation issue with RubyGems (missing "lib")

=== 1.0.2 / 2009-05-10

* Added stubw.exe to gem (was missing 1.0.1)

=== 1.0.1 / 2009-05-05

* Added stub with windows runtime for windowed applications
  (e.g. wxRuby) and fixed issue where OCRA would use ruby.exe instead
  of rubyw.exe for such programs. [#25774]

=== 1.0.0 / 2009-04-05

* 1 major enhancement

  * Birthday!
